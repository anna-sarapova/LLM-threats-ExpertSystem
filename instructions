Steps to Reload the Decision Tree
1. Clear Existing Data
Before reloading the updated decision tree, clear the current data in the database tables to avoid duplication or conflicts.

Run the following in the Django shell:
bash
" python manage.py shell "
Then, execute:
"
from questionnaire.models import Question, Option, Threat
"
# Delete all existing data
"
Question.objects.all().delete()
Option.objects.all().delete()
Threat.objects.all().delete()
"
print("Existing decision tree cleared.")
exit()
2. Update the JSON File
Make the required changes to your decision_tree.json file. Ensure all IDs and references (next_question_id) are updated to maintain integrity.

3. Reload the JSON into the Database
Use the load_questions management command you’ve already implemented to reload the updated decision tree.

Run in bash
" python manage.py load_questions "
If successful, you’ll see:
Decision tree loaded successfully!
